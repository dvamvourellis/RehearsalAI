      "- The argument of being good is subjective and does not directly relate to going on a trip to Europe.\n",
      "- The desire to see different countries and landmarks is valid, but it does not address the practicalities of a trip to Europe.\n",

      "While your enthusiasm and willingness to help are commendable, there are some weak points in your arguments. To improve your arguments, you can consider addressing the practicalities raised by your mother, such as the cost, planning, and energy required for a trip to Europe. You can also research and propose specific ways to make the trip more affordable and manageable. Additionally, you can emphasize the educational and cultural benefits of visiting Europe to further strengthen your arguments.\n"
